This course examines fundamental data structures and algorithms that allow one to write efficient computer programs for the purpose of solving problems of all kinds. By "efficient" it is meant that the resources (both time and space) used by the computer (or network of computers) are proportional to what is theoretically possible, as the size of the problem input grows. Data structures and algorithms are fundamental to all of computing, because without them many common computer applications would either not work, or not work as effectively as one would prefer. Students who complete this course should have a strong appreciation for the basic principles of data structures and algorithms, have an increased ability in general problem-solving skills, and be competent at writing both complex and efficient computer programs.
